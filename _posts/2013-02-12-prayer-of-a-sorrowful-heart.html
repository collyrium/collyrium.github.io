title: Prayer of a Sorrowful Heart
---

<p>Where's my Damascus Road?<br />
My time to find you<br />
A desert place where you speak?<br />
Blinding me beside you,<br />
Teaching</p>
<p>Find me like I am,<br />
Hating you somehow.<br />
Different without you,<br />
An image of myselfâ€¦<br />
Divided</p>
<p>I cry to you when no one hears,<br />
In this sanctum of solitude.<br />
In my heart I curse you,<br />
Do you hear me when I call?<br />
Silent</p>
<p>In spite of you I am here.<br />
When you're nearest to me,<br />
I have already gone.</p>
<p>Wake me from this heavy sleep.<br />
Drawing from within me<br />
A cry for freedom.</p>
