<p>Erroneous Beliefs About Jesus<br />
2005-07-15</p>
<p>We understand that I could never die for my own sins. Jesus, however, was spotless from the beginning. No one else was or will ever be like Jesus. 1 Cor 12:3 - "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." If Jesus was a sinner on the cross, united with the Adversary, it is alright to call him accursed from the time he became sin and the time he beat the devil up, became a Christian, and rose from hell to walk in newness of life.<br />

Where is the Adversary? If Jesus took the keys of hell and death, where did he have to go to get them? If our adversary is roaming about the earth, Jesus wouldn't have found the adversary in hell. If the demons begged Jesus not to throw them into the abyss, they knew that it was a place of torment. Paradise of Hell is bovine spirituality. Jesus's act of obedience and offering for sin defeated the devil. His resurrection was a testament to that. Jesus died as a sign that the Old Covenant was passing away. God was reinstating his relationship with man as a face-to-face interaction. We should view the cross as God's greatest victory, not a stumbling block for The Stumbling Block.</p>

<p>At some level, there is a revelation of the depth of one's confusion. One's imaginations constrain understanding, misconceptions disregard and deny the existence of other relevant conclusions. Taken apart from truth, there is a vast abuse of freedom, perpetuating our misconceptions. Socialized beliefs aided by zealous self-righteousness give credence to the belief of innate moral truths. Scripturally, this is not true. Our innate nature is to hide from our own sinfulness, proclaiming our efforts as worthy of emulation.</p>

<p>Arise in me with passion and direction. Kindle a fire that burns deep within me, motivating me to know you. There is no answer apart from you. Knowledge and wisdom reveal nothing. When I pray, there is no answer. Where do I go? This is the time, I hear. Time to do what? Listen and obey. Hear your word and speak. Stop the pointless knowledge quest. They that glory, let them glory in the Lord.</p>
<p>Intimacy with God<br />

<p>God demands our time. If we give it to him in our bedchamber, we have met the need to meet with him and are therefore closer in tune with his will. When we gather corporately, we have the ability to press deeper into worship (God's okay with spiritual orgies when they concern the adoration of his majesty). He may have us spend some of that time listening to his voice so he can tell us further direction for our own lives. Another possibilty I suggest concerns God's ability to use us to meet the needs of others because we have already met with him ourselves. There is nothing wrong with spending time with him corporately. We MUST worship him regardless of what he is asking us to do, be that worship, listen, or do what he asks us to do.</p>
