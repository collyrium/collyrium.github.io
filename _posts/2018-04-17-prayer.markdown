"A being with a plan and the power to accomplish that plan has no need to be asked to 
do what it will already do — it just does it." --Nike


I've got to confess my hatred for prayer. This sort of hatred, though, isn't because 
I'm an atheist with antitheistic leanings. I hated prayer when I was a Christian for 
the simple reason that it felt pointless. Biblically, God knows what we need, knows 
how to give good gifts to his children, and knows the desires of our hearts. You're 
more important than sparrows and the lilies of the field, so rest in the confidence 
that God has your needs in mind. Praying felt like a way to say to God, "Hey, you 
know that plan you've devised? I think it sucks ass." Jesus made prayer a simple 
"Your kingdom come, your will be done..." that seemed to be more about bending our 
will to the will of God than asking him to bow to ours.


Now, I know what you're thinking — "Hey, Adam, Jesus said to ask and God would give 
good things to his children. This proves that prayer is how we get things from God." 
Let's think about that for a bit. Good things aren't what we call necessities. The 
scripture says that even evil humans know how to give good gifts to their children. 
Here, the most we can learn is that God sometimes gives us our hearts' desires.


So why pray for needs? I'd like to think we will all agree that any lifeguard 
watching a child drown without offering any help would be considered negligent. "You 
didn't ask me enough," our lifeguard says, "so I sat waiting." I wonder why the same 
heavenly father who Jesus said was better than humans in his gift giving can't be 
bothered to take care of his children's needs without being asked. Humans who don't 
provide for their children get arrested, but the God of the Universe gets worshiped.
The best I can glean from this reality is that God does not feel compelled to help 
his own children. Perhaps it's part of his eternal plan to allow my co-worker's 
husband to die following months of agony with the loss of both legs and all kidney 
function. I fail to see how such a plan cannot be accomplished if he were to have 
been healed.


"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing?
Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing?
Then why call him God?"
- Epicurus
