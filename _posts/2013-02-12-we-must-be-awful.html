title: We Must Be Awful
---

<p>The commonly held misconception is that atheists, and more specifically formerly religious atheists, will give themselves to gross, irrational behaviors to the detriment of their families and the society. While morality, as defined by religious tradition, looks much different from true societal morality, the non-religious are often more convinced of their morality from a philosophical perspective, and are therefore more moral. This is not to say that there are not countless examples littered throughout the atheist world of foolish dereliction of moral duty, though the religious are not exempt simply on the basis of their beliefs. In either case, our weakened philosophical reasoning, at least partly made so by the prevalence of religion, is more to blame for these examples than the increasingly popular denouncement of an invisible god.</p>
<p>The religious justify their moral positions through the faith that their god's word is final. In a mock conversation with their deity of choice regarding the reasons for a particular "moral" behavior, the "answers" typically given to a two-year-old, namely, "Because I said so!", are all they require. It is admirable, at times, to see the dedication of the religious to seemingly foolish dictates such as length of hair or style of bathing suit or gender of their lover. This style of morality, however, is no more beneficial to society than a decision to always slice carrots to a 1/4" thickness before cooking them. On matters of social importance, it is often the non-religious who excel.</p>
<p>The frequent (and unjust) mistreatment of the "immoral", the messages of eternal damnation employed by religious fearmongers, and the lofty claims to infallible revelation lead not to social progress. Even the Christian bible claims that laws do nothing to promote true morality. As an animal, we are inclined to cheat, steal, or lie at times. It is not the religious doctrines which pull man from this pit of immorality, rather it is our ascent to the underlying common sense contained within religious doctrines, those concepts which exist within any civilized society irrespective of religious conviction, to which we must hold fast. Religion, a glorified system of barbarism with a few moral truths, leads more toward bigotry than to peace and progress. The persecution of homosexuals, for example, does not proceed from those who recognize no social harm in such personal opinions, but from the religious absolutists, wielding scriptural swords prepared for holy war against any and all violators. The unchallenged hate of behaviors on the basis of some antique collection of unenlightened phrases must cease. As I have said earlier, it is certain that there are vile atheists who have never lived an unselfish life. We need look no further than the Founding Fathers of America, though, to find generally irreligious men of outstanding moral and political aptitude given their time. It was intentional that religion and homage to "God" or "Jesus Christ", though often appearing in documents from the 13 colonies at the time, were left out of the Declaration of Independence. Many great minds have often posited that religion does nothing more than to provide a useful tool to political leaders. It is with great appreciation that we are the benefactors of what Thomas Jefferson considered a "wall of separation between church and state". Thankfully we may never be forced by governmental decree to circumcise our sons on the eighth day or to offer sacrifices upon an altar in Washington, D.C., the most logical location of a national synagogue.</p>
<p>As atheists, there are many moral areas upon which we may improve. It has not been properly determined if life begins at the rise of a unique DNA strand (aka, conception) or whether we should value our own species, in all its forms, over the lives of other animals. We shall certainly disagree with the religious as to the morality of premarital sex or homosexuality, but we shall not differ on the value of definite human life. Let us proceed with trust in our collective philosophical abilities and lay aside the weights which so easily beset us, specifically religion in all its forms. James Madison once said, "During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity, in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution." Science, Reason, and the Love of Wisdom will never be summarized so detestably, for they subject themselves willingly to open opposition and give equal footing to any rationally justifiable position.</p>
