title: Raped Mind
---

<p>Pharmaceutical preachers propagate their gospel,<br />
Commercializing deceit and envy for fame.<br />
They cry in the streets for all who hear<br />
Urging, "Come and get your 'dab will do ya'."</p>
<p>Delve into the world they sell you,<br />
Colorful capsules of gluttony and fear,<br />
Packaging so convincing and grotesque,<br />
Get addicted and come back for more.</p>
<p>A cold heart can see what blinded eyes cannot,<br />
Raped in their homes and addicted to god.<br />
They sacrifice at the altar of nonsense their sanity for security,<br />
Yet do not perceive it.</p>
<p>They accept the lie that freedom can be bought,<br />
They take a little Angel Dust to lift the burden of their souls.<br />
Tithing to the industry that made them,<br />
They forget about the pain for now, teaching others to do the same.</p>
