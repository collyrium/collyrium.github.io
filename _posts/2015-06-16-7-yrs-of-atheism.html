title: Seven Years of Atheism
---

<p>This week marks approximately seven-and-a-half years of disbelief for me. On December 11,
2007, I asked the Christian god to forgive me for trusting reality more than his silence.
I told him that I would gladly believe him if I met him face to face, but figured he&rsquo;d be
enough of a gentleman to forgive my disbelief given the standard of evidence I was learning
to demand for extraordinary claims. I would believe, I told him, if he could prove himself
to be an intervening god in an undeniable way that would not only satisfy my own requirements
for proof but also those of all of humanity. I didn&rsquo;t suppose it would be difficult for the
god of Elijah, a god who answered by fire when Elijah called upon him to put the prophets of
Baal to an open shame for their disbelief, to prove himself. Elijah waited for less than 12
hours. Seven years have passed and the gods are still silent. Seven years have given me the
time to grow bold like Elijah when he goaded the prophets of Baal. I ask the same question,
&ldquo;Where is your god? Maybe he&rsquo;s sleeping or using the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know silence is neither proof nor disproof of an interventionist god, and yet I feel
confident that there is no good reason to jump to belief. Possibility of a god means nothing
more than that I am possibly going to be shocked to meet one. I will never be wrong for or
fearful that I am missing out because of my skepticism.</p>
