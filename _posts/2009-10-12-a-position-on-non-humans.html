title: A Position on Non-Humans
---

<p>Animals, as individuals, have peculiarities and personalities unique to themselves.  They feel and think, fear and mourn.  Desires not much unlike our own compel them to action, driving them to seek pleasure or attempt to avoid pain.  The possession of these traits places them clearly in the realm of the sentient organisms -- a class of organisms who are aware of their world, feeling, thinking, and who possess the desire to manipulate their condition to their favor.</p>
<p>Given that the above is rarely debated, particularly among mammals, it becomes difficult for me to understand why we so carelessly expose these animals to slavery-like conditions into which they are forced (we have yet to obtain clear consent from them) to produce some good or service for our own personal pleasure.  This situation may have been permitted prior to revolutionized farming techniques and readily available food and clothing alternatives, but we have no continued need in such a careless act.  The animals are none the better for our usage, and we, like parasites, are the sole benefactor of such an arrangement.</p>
<p>Foresight and compassion are often considered among the uniquely human character traits, though non-human animals do not currently stand to benefit from these unless we consider a particular animal property.  We teach our children to honor individual preferences, reprimanding them for abusing humans OR non-humans.  What parent gladly watches as her child pokes a dog in the eye or shoves a toy into a cat's rectum?  We demand respect of sentient beings when we do not stand to benefit while holding dear their products when our taste or sense of style stirs us to exploit them.  Our selfish desires motivate the enslavement of non-human animals without honoring the basic interests of those organisms to the maximum extent that our own survival depends.  Scientific data indicate that we are quite capable of living a healthy, fulfilled life free of animal products.  Where is the foresight of the human race when we care little for the present and future interests of innocent creatures in deference to our gustatory preferences?  To be selfish is to be alive, to be thoughtless is sadly regarded as common, but to remain so after being made aware of gross abuses of other creatures is an overestimation of one's own humanity.</p>
<p>Why do we care so little for the abuses of others?  As stated previously, we are selfish.  Our own desires trump those of others until significant societal pressures place our selfishness in the forefront and demand that we change or be cast out of that society.  At this point, non-humans do not have rights afforded to them on the basis of their existence; they are given any rights they may possess on an individual basis.  Abuses rendered toward animals are condoned if an organism is not regarded as another's property and/or the law makes clear the rights of the human with regard to the abuse of particular animals in given circumstances.  More plainly, humans can do what they want when they want as long as other humans aren't involved or the majority isn't offended by what is done.  What motivates us to act so cruelly toward animals?  Very little beyond personal pleasure.  We harvest milk reserved for infant offspring for our own enjoyment and then eat the baby.  We do not thank the animals; we grind them up to become our next meal.  In winter, we enjoy down feather coats and leather jackets despite alternatives.  Why?  We like the look or feel.  What is the difference between these and the abuses we condemn that our children inflict out of pleasure upon the same animals?  I contend that we are blinded to one and horrified by the other.</p>
<p>Given that we have the ability to reduce the violation of the conscious will of non-human animals by living a life of respect toward them, it becomes an issue of personal preference.  Do we feel that it is good to hold a dog by the neck to the floor for fun?  Is it fine to kick a cow or tip it for the thrill?  If so, we are a base society in my opinion.  If not, why not?  I contend it is no different than forcing chickens to live in constant contrast to their natural desires.  We all, human and non-human alike, demand freedom from slavery.  Our power over animals is wrongly used.  Let us utilize this power toward their benefit rather than to satisfy our careless personal preferences.</p>
