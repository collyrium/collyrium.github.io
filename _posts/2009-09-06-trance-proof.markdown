title: Trance Is Not Proof!
---

I wanted see some old friends and was only going to be in town for a brief visit in September 2009. Since everyone was at church, I decided to go and couldn't help but feel moved to jot down a few thoughts while everyone else was singing. I wrote the following paragraph on the back of the church flyer.

>**TRANCE != PROOF**
>
>The emotional connection to a loving god is felt in songs as eyes are closed and hearts take over critical thought. Group worship and collective desire to see a "move of God"
>and to "gather at the feet" dominate the air. Cries for sight beyond sight provide an almost natural relief to the emotional slumber from a week away from the divine. Softly muttered
>glossolalia, repetitive phrases, and occasional posturing usher one into the warm trance of timelessness. While quiet, they feel the presence of the divine hovering over them and
>may hear the LORD speaking to them in vague flitterings of their minds.
