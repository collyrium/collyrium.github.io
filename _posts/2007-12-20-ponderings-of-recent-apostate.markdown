title: Ponderings of a recent apostate
---

It is not enough for God to convince me of his existence, much less for the Christian god to only tell ME of himself.  Were he to prove himself to me, I would be none the richer since this knowledge would condemn me without benefiting the rest of the world.  Are we to be damned for questioning or lacking certainty by a god who, according to Christian tradition and scripture, is pursuing a relationship with ALL?  Why do we strive to save people from God's wrath by giving them God?  We save men from the wicked end of eternity in hell while vindecating God from his part in their doom.  If, as is told, God gave his only son for all men and compels men to know him on the basis of faith (which comes through hearing a message from someone who obtained like faith; it was not his own), a faith leads us to eternal life, what of those who do not believe?

As a young Christian, I believed that an understanding God's love would more completely reveal itself to me after having children.  I did not, to clarify, believe that I would understand the giving of a son, but rather the love for a people with such intensity otherwise unknown to me.  Biblically, God has such a great love for those of us who love him that he sent his son for all of us in hopes that some of us would believe and be saved.

>By threats of the wrath of God, the Father draws souls to his Son. For many have found advantage (as we have proved, and are daily proving by actual experiment), in being first compelled by fear or pain, so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching, or might follow out in act what they had already learned in word.  (St Augustine of Hippo (354-430))

Do I tell people about my recent conversion (12/2007) or just wait for things to become self-evident?

Is Jesus like Santa?
