title: Desolate Grave of the Insane
---

<p>Entombed, cradled, swaddled in grave clothes,<br />
Forced upon me, raping with its threats.<br />
I am the sepulcher of a demigod.</p>
<p>Requisite homage, subservience, love?<br />
This the way of a master.<br />
I am the serf of an apparition.</p>
<p>Guilty of honest inquiry, I have questioned the One.<br />
Failing to see mercy in abject mental poverty,<br />
I am the sincerely unconvinced.</p>
<p>Emptiness beneath an unforgiving sky,<br />
Echoing in the minds of the mourning,<br />
I am the desolate grave of the insane.</p>
