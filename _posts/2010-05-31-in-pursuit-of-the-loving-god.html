title: In Pursuit of the Loving God
---

<p>"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give." (Matt. 10:8)</p>
<p>To whom is this love expressed,<br />
Upon the altar of sacrifice?<br />
And to whom do I owe gratitude<br />
For pardoning me?</p>
<p>Is this love, that one would die upon a tree,<br />
That one would save me from himself?<br />
Forgiven like a pig for being me<br />
Or fried like bacon and consumed.</p>
<p>Beloved one who rescues me,<br />
Why do you demand my worship?</p>
<p>Adam<br />
