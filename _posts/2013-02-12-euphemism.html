<p>Did pagan blood drip<br />
From his screaming veins?</p>
<p>Stand here.</p>
<p>Tell me that line again<br />
Where we all winâ€¦</p>
<p>Is this your Underground Railroad?<br />
My Sweet Chariot to carry me home<br />
Down the Yellow-brick road<br />
Paved by the Slave himself.</p>
<p>Is this absurd to think?<br />
I now wear his soiled robes<br />
With pride I hide my face<br />
In your open-air market of disgrace.</p>
<p>It's my refuse you refuse,<br />
The rest of me can stay to pay<br />
To listen to euphonious eulogies<br />
For your dead itinerant demagogue.</p>
<p>Is that about right?<br />
I disgust you.</p>
