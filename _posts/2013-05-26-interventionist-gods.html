title: Interventionist Gods

<p>Prayer doesn't work! If it did, we would hear stories about how everything was before we discovered prayer and we'd hardly believe that things could have been so bad. People of faith cling to scriptures such as Matthew 7:11, a portion of text that is attributed to Jesus himself, when asked why they continue to pray given such miserable results. The text states, "If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (English Standard Version, Â©2001)</p>
<p>Say a prayer to your god and see what happens. Odds are, you're praying for something that is hardly difficult for your god to do given its proclaimed skill set. Wait a while...and repeat. It sucks, but that's how things go. YouTube isn't filled with videos, dubious or not, of people providing proofs of prayer's efficacy. There's a shortage of claims because prayer's wishful thinking placebo effects can't regenerate limbs, fix chromosomal abnormalities, or resurrect the cremated. Prayer doesn't prevent child torture or starvation. I'd say that's proof enough that prayers don't work. If your god exists, it certainly doesn't intervene in tangible, meaningful ways.</p>
